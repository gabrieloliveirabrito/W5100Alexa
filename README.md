# W5100Alexa
**A implementation of EspAlexa for EthernetShield**

I created this library based on [EspAlexa](https://github.com/Aircoookie/Espalexa/) and [FauxmoEsp](https://github.com/vintlabs/fauxmoESP/), but using the Ethernet library with Shield W5100.

So far, the project receives **UDP** packets normally, however the *Echo* device does not make **HTTP** requests, which work normally if done manually.
